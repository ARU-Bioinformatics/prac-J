# Practical J: numpy, pandas and matplotlib

Before starting this exercise you should work through
**Chapter 4 numpy** from the
[DataCamp online course Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).  
We will then use what you have learnt there to explore how biological 
sequence data can be handled in Python.

To use this exercise you should either:

## Getting Started Instructions using Google Colab

Google Colab is another service that allows you to run and work on Jupyter 
in the cloud. 
* Colab requires a Google login (that you will already have if you use gmail) and
  uses GoogleDrive for storage.
* The Google Colab user interface is different from Jupyter Notebook but straight forward to use.

To start this practical using Google Colab:
 * [workbook_J_1.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
   * [workbook_J_2.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
   * [workbook_J_3.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
   * [workbook_J_4.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/workbook_B.ipynb)
* [homework_J.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-B/blob/master/homework_B.ipynb)

Then in your Colab Notebook or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the four workbooks and work through them.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **exercise_J.ipynb**
* then follow the instructions on Canvas page:
